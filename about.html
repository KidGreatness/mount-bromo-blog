						Mount Bromo is probably one of the most famous scenic attraction in East Java of Indonesia. It is famous for its magnificent sunrise views and view of volcano crater there, which is very rare to see. That goes well for Kawah Ijen Volcano Crater.
					</p>
					<p>
						Bromo is still one of the most active volcanoes in the world and there are areas that blocked off from tourists due to its imminent danger. Because of that, Mount Bromo was automatically on my bucket list to be checked off when I was visiting Indonesia.
					</p>
					<p>
						My starting point was in Bali and I had to take a bus from Ubung Bus Terminal to Probolinggo for the first leg of the trip.
					</p>
					<p>
						In the early morning at Ubung bus terminal, there wasn't any ticket window and I would have to negotiate with the bus representatives swarming around the bus terminal trying to sell you bus tickets. One thing you need to note: No toilet breaks. However, you can use the toilets at the ferry. The bus will take the ferry across, reducing the hassle of buying separate ferry tickets. You can buy food on the ferry as well.
